![Templates Hero image](images/flask_templates/template.jpg)

A template is basically an HTML file. In our previous lesson [Getting Started With Flask](03_getting_started_with_flask.md), we learnt how to display the text "Hello, world" on a browser. What if you want to add more structure to your application, like paragraphs and images? How can you do that in Flask? This is where templates come in. They allow us to achieve all the structural features we may want added to our application.
